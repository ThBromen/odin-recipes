      <h1>Recipes instruction</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          Prepare pastry: Combine flour, curry powder, and salt in a bowl.
          Cut<br />
          in margarine and shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.<br />
          Stir in water until mixture forms a ball. Shape dough into a log
          and<br />
          cut it into 10 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 6-inch circle<br />
          (approximately 1/8-inch thick) on a lightly floured surface; set<br />
          aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepare filling: Melt margarine in a skillet over medium heat.
          Sauté<br />
          onion until soft and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in ground
          beef;<br />
          season with curry powder, thyme, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring<br />
          constantly, until beef is evenly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in<br />
          beef broth and bread crumbs. Simmer until liquid is absorbed;
          remove<br />
          from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spoon equal amounts of filling onto each pastry circle. Fold over
          and<br />
          press edges together, making a half-circle. Use the back of a fork
          to<br />
          seal edges, then brush tops with beaten egg. Place pastries on a<br />
          baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
